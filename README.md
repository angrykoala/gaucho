> The Minimalist Task Launcher

Gaucho is an open-source, customizable task launcher to run your apps, commands or scripts.
Configure your commands and run them in a non-intrusive interface. Say goodbye to dozens of terminals.
Check https://angrykoala.github.io/gaucho/ to get started.

As a developer, it is quite common to repeat the same commands over an over. Running an app, starting a server, compiling your code or building a front-end for example. Most of these are just background tasks that just need to be running, or executed from time to time. Typing the command is slow, and having a terminal per task consumes our precious screen real state. Gaucho provides a simple way to de-clutter your screen by bundling all of those tasks in a simple menu to run and stop these, quick, and simple.

Just add a name, type a command as you would in your terminal, set any env variable or path needed and you are good to go!

## Usage
> Check the [Official docs](https://angrykoala.github.io/gaucho/docs/intro) for the updated documentation

Gaucho allows you to configure **tasks** that can be grouped in **suites**. Each task can be configured by providing a name and command. Tasks can be executed independently, or the whole suite can be executed as once.

### Creating and Editing tasks
By clicking the _Edit_ button (top right corner). You'll enter the **edit mode** that allows you to create, delete, update and move tasks

You can add new tasks to the current suite by clicking _"Add New Task"_ at the bottom of the list. By clicking on a task name you'll be able to edit that task.

While editing/creating a new tasks, you should add a _name_ to the task and a _command_. The command can be any shell/terminal accepted command or an executable file. Optionally a _path_ can be added as well, if no path is added, default user path will be used.

The tasks can be deleted by clicking the _Delete_ button. In this mode you can also move tasks (clicking on the drag handle), reorder suites, create suites (+ button), delete and rename suites and tasks (through the [context menu](#context-menu))
